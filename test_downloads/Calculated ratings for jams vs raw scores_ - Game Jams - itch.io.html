Statistically speaking, you can say that the more ratings something has, the more accurate the rating is. Something with very few ratings is likely to be significantly off from what it would have gotten had everyone in the jam had the opportunity to rate it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it would pretty much happen in most jams since itâs common for people to ignore projects that they donât think look good. It would be very upsetting to people who put in a lot of effort into their projects to get beaten by an ignored project that got 1 vote.</p>
<p>Another advantage of penalizing projects with very few ratings is that it encourages people to want to get more ratings, and the best way to do that is rating other peopleâs projects and leaving a comment. It helps build a better jam community.</p>
<p>The rating system skew on itch.io works by looking at the medium number of ratings for the entire jam, so it adjusts itself to how much people are rating in the jam, and doesnât get skewed by a minority of projects that get a large number of ratings.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Iâm not sure how small youâre talking about, but if the entire jam only has a few ratings in total then at that point the final results are probably not valid in any case.</p>
<p>Hope that explains.</p>

<p>Sorry, not at all. How it really works is (from my experience in 2021):</p>
<p>- you have no idea that there is a penalty, and how many ratings are needed at least to not get the penalty</p>
<p>- you get a few ratings and think it&#x27;s enough</p>
<p>- jam voting ends</p>
<p>- you get penalized</p><p>Encourage and punish are two opposite things.<br></p>
<p>Personally I would prefer the Ludum Dare system - constant minimum amount of ratings, and a clear message about this.</p>

I entered a jam recently where the most popular entries were topping out at less than 30 votes (niche interest area running a friendly jam). I&#x27;m assuming in order for the lower half of the field not to get heavily penalised for having a few less votes than the top half, the people running it actually did their own manual calculations for the results release. It seemed unfair for an entry to slide a few places down in the rankings (and in one case affected who won a category) because of the difference of a few votes. Being a niche area means it is quite hard to get &quot;lots of votes&quot;. More interaction can mean more votes which is a good thing, but when the difference can be in the single digits as to where the penalty line is, it&#x27;s pretty disheartening for games that slide under that barrier. (and let&#x27;s face it, about half the entries in a comp are going to go that way no matter how interactive everyone is or is not. My game was not one of those affected this time so that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m complaining, I just feel for some comp types it isn&#x27;t very fair.)<br></p>
<p>In theory it&#x27;s a good idea to stop an unpopular entry with a handful of perfect votes from the dev&#x27;s friends winning over a more popular and better made one with 200 votes over a range of scores, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for the smaller jams where if you get 20 votes your score might be unaffected, but if you get 19 you&#x27;re penalised. An option like Igor suggested or to just work off raw scores rather than calculated ones would be good for those. I&#x27;m assuming not an option though considering it&#x27;s been this way for at least the 3 years since I posted this thread.<br></p></div><div class="post_footer"><a data-register_action="community_vote" class="post_action vote_btn" href="/login?intent=community&amp;return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fitch.io%2Ft%2F644401%2Fcalculated-ratings-for-jams-vs-raw-scores"><span class="icon-like"></span><span class="like_text"> Like</span></a><a data-register_action="community_reply" class="post_action reply_btn" href="/login?intent=community&amp;return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fitch.io%2Ft%2F644401%2Fcalculated-ratings-for-jams-vs-raw-scores">Reply</a></div></div></div></div><div class="community_post_replies"><div id="post-8977211" class="community_post is_reply" data-post="{&quot;id&quot;:8977211,&quot;user_id&quot;:7946818}"><div class="post_grid"><a class="avatar_container" href="/profile/redonihunter"><div class="post_avatar" style="background-image: url(/static/images/frog-gold.png)"></div></a><div class="post_header"><span class="post_author"><a href="/profile/redonihunter">redonihunter</a></span><span class="post_date" title="2023-12-04 10:24:01"><a href="/post/8977211">2 years ago</a></span><span class="vote_counts"></span></div><div class="post_content"><div dir="auto" class="post_body user_formatted"><p>I think the most important argument here is, that not voting is counted as a vote of some sorts.

<p>The formula for jam ratings is <code>adjustment = sqrt(min(median, votes_received) / median)</code></p>
<p>The adjustment for game that got 19 votes in a jam with median of 20 is = <code>0.97467</code>, about a 2.5% reduction in average score, eg. a 4.5 rating would go to 4.386 for the purpose of comparison during ranking.</p>

No matter the game jam, 50% of submissions will always receive a score penalty.â That number <em>might</em> be reasonable for something with 1000s of entries where score manipulation issues may be harder to deal with, but I donât see why such a large range of submissions should always be pushed down just because they werenât ranked enough times. Maybe it could be lowered to a 25th percentile for smaller jams - or better yet, selected by the jam host beforehand.</p>

This system makes a ton of sense to me, from a statistics angle. Having been on both sides of the median in jams, I understand the âpenaltyâ feeling people are describing though.</p>
<p>This is kind of a silly solution, but it could be effective to simply multiply all of the final adjusted scores by 20 to change the scale to 100 points. The adjusted score effectively becomes a âpercentileâ rank of sorts. Itâs more of a psychological trick than anything, but the difference in scale might mitigate the direct comparison with the raw score that makes some people feel like they got a penalty.</p>

The point of the âpenaltyâ is to allow for a way to rank every game against every other game as fair as possible.</p>
<p>I think the mistake here is referring to it as a penalty, because it suggests to people they did something wrong with their submission. In reality, itâs more appropriate to call it an adjustment, as itâs serves as a mechanism to more fairly rank every game against every other game.</p>
<p>As an example, if your game got 10 votes with an average rating of 4.5, and someone else got 100 votes with an average rating of 4.5. Do you think itâs fair they rank above you? I think so, since theyâve managed to collect that many more votes while still maintaining a relatively high score.</p>
<p>If there is a fixed number minimum number of ratings required, then itâs going to create a distortion in rankings to the people who collect exactly that number of ratings. A lower number of ratings creates higher variance in the average score compared to a submission with a higher number of ratings. There is a chance the lower-number-of-ratings project has a non-representative score that could bump them above a game that got substantially more ratings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you get a few ratings and think itâs enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you care about your results in a ranked jam, then I recommend participating in the voting process throughout the duration. Rate other peopleâs work and leave comments. Itâs the best way allow others to discover your submission. If youâve only collected a âfewâ ratings, then itâs unlikely your raw average score is representative in a way that can be compared to submissions that received substantially more ratings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how many ratings are needed at least to not get the penalty</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal is not to tell you to hit a target number of ratings, as that essentially encourages people to try to game the ranking system. Instead, your goal as a participant is to continue to collect ratings. The more ratings you collect, the more âaccurateâ your average score is relative the number of ratings collected by all other submissions.</p>

<p>This is debatable, the increase attention of a page may skew the voting bias of a rater to lower. In my experience, once a population size increases outside a core set of fans into general audience, you attract people who are more likely to casually rate things very low.</p>
